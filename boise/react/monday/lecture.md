~1000   - INTERACTIVITY
** would like to maybe have them try and make a clock happen?**
after have an html thing up, go ahead and create some UI and state that needs to be kept up to date!
- # that clock though...

after setting up the clock, discuss some pros and cons of the approach
bring up class as a way to data and its behaviors
functions as a way to organize instructions

abstract our clock class inot a react component

talk about how react tries to solve all of these problems

slowly add teh various peices of react to the application

reactify it, will have to talk about props, state, and lifecycle hooks

then add jsx via script tag


lastly put whole thing together and help them get it on their machines too
